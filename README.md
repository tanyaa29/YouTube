# YouTube Clone Application

Welcome to the YouTube Clone Application! This project is a web-based application built using React and Redux, designed to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube. Here are some of the key features and technologies used in this project:

## Features:

### 1. Live YouTube API Integration
   - This YouTube clone seamlessly integrates with the YouTube Live API to provide real-time video content.

### 2. Optimized Search Engine
   - Implemented a powerful search engine with debouncing to enhance search performance and provide a smooth user experience.

### 3. Real-time Comment Section
   - Employed the concept of API polling to create a real-time comment section, just like YouTube's live chat. We took care that the page does not crash even with millions of live comments popping every second.

### 4. Nested Comments
   - This application supports nested comments using recursion, allowing users to engage in meaningful discussions within video comments.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: The core of our front-end user interface is built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

- **Redux**: used Redux for state management, ensuring efficient data flow and a well-structured application.

- **YouTube Live API**: Integration with the YouTube Live API enables us to fetch and display real-time video content.

- **Debouncing**: We've implemented debouncing in the search engine to minimize unnecessary API requests and provide faster search results.

- **API Polling**: Our real-time comment section utilizes API polling to fetch and display live comments.

- **Recursion**: The use of recursion allows for nested comments, enhancing the depth of user interactions within video comments.

## Ongoing Development:
I am working on adding more functionality and improving the UI of the application,
